            <h3>
                &emsp;&emsp;In the short amount of time that we’ve known each other, we have gotten to understand the other person quite well. Our bond at its earliest days was fueled by a lot of attraction and curiosity, with moments of doubt and incongruence due to the nascency of our connection. To be honest, there were many times in our early days when I felt that things weren’t gonna work out between us. I am now writing to you, as a very happy Ivy who is deeply, deeply in love, feeling grateful about the fact that I was wrong :) I don’t really know why, or how it happened, but we got more and more compatible over time. Both of us don’t really like yelling or arguing, but the times when conflicts did arise and trigger our emotions became pivotal points that eventually led us to be closer to each other. 
            </h3>
            <h3>
                &emsp;&emsp;It’s really hard to put these things into words, partly because I don’t fully understand them. I just know that I feel very good with you, and in days when life feels really hard, knowing that I will be seeing you gives me the strength to carry on and try again. Even when you’re far away, the knowledge that you care about me, and are always reminding me to prioritize my sleep and diet when I’m too focused on work, makes me feel like our lives are connected in a way that transcends their physical distance. Our love right now feels like leaves —— after a passionate summer dance —— finally settling into the soil to the smell of petrichor, resting their control in the security of a quite winter morning. 
            </h3>
            <h3>
                I guess I just wrote all that to say I really love you. Thank you for all the ways that you try for me, adjust to me, and care for me. I have tried to grow a lot within our relationship, I hope you feel as loved by me as I really do love you with my actions and attempts to grow. I know there are many things about me that are different from a “normal person”, some of them are good, some are questionable. I apologize for all the ways in which I’m crazy and neurotic, I can’t promise that I will stop being that way haha. But I will always try my best for you :)
